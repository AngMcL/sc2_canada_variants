In the case of a COVID-19 outbreak, the regional public health directorate will conduct epidemiological investigations and issue directives concerning the withdrawl of students and staff who have had contact with the case. In areas where masking is mandatory in the classroom, a primary or secondary student who has had contact with a case of COVID-19 in school will not need to temporarily withdraw from school and extracurricular activities. In areas where masking is not mandatory, primary students who have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 may continue in school wearing a mask for 10 days, but must not engage in extracurricular activities; fully vaccinated secondary students who have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 will not need to isolate or wear masks and will be able to continue extracurricular activities; students not fully vaccinated must wear masks for 10 days and will be restricted in school activities, but must not participate in extracurricular activities covered by the vaccine passport. School service centres, school boards and private educational institutions will take various measures to ensure continuity of services for students temporarily withdrawn from the environment; minimum thresholds will apply when students are isolated or a class is closed, in accordance with the school's emergency protocol, to give everyone a chance to continue learning.
